Hive IA control of Honey Bee for person with disability,https://www.hackster.io/davide-cogliati/hive-ia-control-of-honey-bee-for-person-with-disability-0ab4dc,"My work is very technical, developing prototypes on request by costumers and working out all the board components and the development. This is something I like to do with passion. My main hobby is agriculture and honey bees growing all played as a second work with a lot of passion and willing. My hobby requires full movement capability because bee hives should be inspected periodically to recognize if some kind of problem is facing up. Why not to make this amazing activity accessible to people with disability that can't be free to work phisycally on the hives as I can. I think could be wonderful to make accessible an important part of this activity to everybody, makes you feel satisfied of what you are doing, you can do it! So I imagined after several days and weeks of observation that hearing to sound coming from a Hive can give many information on state of health, strenght, working willness of the bees. To do this some hardware is necessary, the best is to develop something low cost yet wotking well. This is not sufficient to do this development, more,  is necessary an appropriate software playing some specified rules that can help you to understand the data (sound) coming from a hive. I spent lot of time to think about these rules and what I developed yet being quite easy seems to work well  against what I can observe in the hive. Hoping this work can be useful to whom  has phisycal limitation but a high grade of willness to start their own activity with honey bees, and this can become a real work for them. No limits to your passion. "

This innovative belt combines the power of  sonar, gyroscopes, and other tracking sensors to offer dynamic, real-time navigational support. As the swimmer progresses, the belt processes data from these sensors, allowing the device to determine the optimal course and provide immediate feedback.  Through auditory cues transmitted via  haptic vibrations, the swimmer receives continuous orientation information from Haptic Vibration Sensor. This eliminates the requirement for a second person to guide them and promotes an independent swimming experience. The Assistive Guidance belt goes beyond mere collision avoidance; it empowers visually impaired individuals to swim confidently in a straight line while being aware of their surroundings at all times.This belt also comes with emergency features Like Airbag Deployment,Laser light to attract guards during emergency etc"

Chess Vision-Inclusive,https://www.hackster.io/smprof/chess-vision-inclusive-264401,"The project aims to bridge the gap between digital chess platforms and tactile, inclusive gameplay for individuals with visual disabilities. Leveraging computer vision technology, our system will interface with popular chess platforms like chess.com, capturing moves from the screen (whether on a desktop or mobile device) and translating them to a physical, tactile chess set. This innovation goes beyond existing solutions by enabling real-time, interactive play on a physical board, creating a seamless and inclusive gaming experience. Our project aligns with the growing interest in accessibility within the chess community, as seen in chess.com's recent initiatives. Additionally, our technology has the potential for broader applications, enhancing the gaming experience for all and promoting inclusivity in digital entertainment. Through integration with platforms like Feelif Chess, we aspire to create a universal solution that empowers individuals with visual impairments to enjoy chess across various digital environments.What we completed:"

Why not to use something flashing in a special way to show the presence of the wheelchair and the disable boy riding it. Something really simple and easy to build but effective. I think working objects should not be complicated but easy to use and to understand. To present this idea at the ""build2together"" challenge I thought to something very easy and cheap to find, but it is what you need, not costly hardware but most simple."

My project does not fit perfectly into the swimming solution challenge, it is more of a general mobility tool for individuals who have visual impairments.  My fiance and her son have a genetic eye condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa. Living with a visually impaired partner has allowed me to witness the challenges that people with vision disabilities face on a daily basis. I have worked with her closely to develop a tool that can assist her and others with visual impairments in navigating environments where obstacle avoidance is necessary. This project began before I learned about the Build2Gether challenge. Over the course of a year I have learned to use M5stack and UIflow. To learn the platform, I challenged myself  to rapidly prototype an idea a day. During this time I began developing the basic framework for this project with input from my partner. My hope is that this will stand as an example of what can be achieved through a willingness to learn, diligence, and care. M5stack provides a powerful platform for rapidly prototyping and testing these kinds of devices. This project would not have been possible without the ingenuity of M5stack's products, code logic advice from Jilles Groenendijk, and the priceless input from my wonderful partner Amanda. Getting to speak with Marc Chiang was an absolute treat. He and my partner have the same eye condition. Mr. Chiang shared resources with her as well as providing input and perspective for this project. This is a labor of love. No neural networks,  apart from human, were used to generate this code or design."

Detect face for playing game with no hands,https://www.hackster.io/nguyenhuuvinhhanoi/detect-face-for-playing-game-with-no-hands-309703,"Last summer, I had a memorable time working with Arduino in a camp for disabled people with my school program. In that camp, I saw that unlucky children can not play games without using their hands, they lost their hands in an accident. I'm extremely hurt. They are 18 years old, the same age as me but they study really hard and face bad problems that no one can't imagine. I think that there are some way for they can playing with no-hand. So I started this project 2 months and want to create some way to play game without using hand. I saw that in ""pyautogui"" and some library in python can help me to that. ""Pyautogui"" can help me control keyboard and screen with coding. The second problem is how to run that code to control keyboard. I think the best way is basing on face of users. In youtube, there are some way to control mouse with the movement of face. With that, I think we can use our face to play game, control the game without using hand. In the future, I sure that I will create more about detecting to play advance game and I want a world where people lost their hands can playing game. Thanks you"

This system was intended to use the direct image of the pool bottom, in coordination with a gyroscope for accuracy, to identify the lane lines and use them to provide a haptic signal via vibrational motors on each side of the device. This would allow for a swimmer with vision impairments to swim independently and in full control of their orientation device.

In order to help this kind of people, we developed a smart cane which has quite a lot of sensors and can do quite a bit of AI processing onboard. We use Avnet brainium module to detect obstacles and gestures so that it can help an end-user like a blind or physically challenged individual.     In current economic conditions, the earning for the home has to be done by both male and female individual in order to pay out the bills at the end of the month. This is a common practice in an urban area where basic living costs are exorbitant.       As a result of this practice, elderly people are left back in the home when young ones go out for earning.

Swim safe and flashy,https://www.hackster.io/rachael2/swim-safe-and-flashy-049030,"The design consists of a wearable-detachable waterproof red light and a protection cushion. The red light gives other swimmers in the pool a signal that a blind swimmer is approaching. When seeing the light, other swimmers automatically clear the line and give extra space for the blind swimmer. Additionally, since the blind swimmers cannot predict where the edge of the swimming pool is, or where the other people are, they are very likely hitting the wall or bumping into other people. To protect the blind swimmers, a floating cushion is designed to buffer the hit. At the same time, it serves as a secondary notice for other swimmers to keep their distance. In the worst-case scenario, other swimmers will not hurt the blind swimmers, but the impact is safely absorbed by the cushion."
Travel safe and sound,https://www.hackster.io/rachael2/travel-safe-and-sound-f7ff28,"It is very hard for people in wheelchairs to travel alone, as they constantly require help and care from others. However, by simply installing an alarm on the wheelchair, disabled individuals are able to travel on their own. Whenever something is needed, they can simply press the button, and a pre-recorded message will be announced. People within 10 meters of distance can clearly hear the message and rapidly come to help. As a simple example, the disabled personnel can record “excuse me, could you help me” in the device (so that you can travel ‘safe’ but also with ‘sound’, hence the title ‘travel safe and sound’). After pressing the button and getting a willing volunteer to help, the disabled personnel can communicate his needs in better detail. In this way, finally, people with disability can travel alone without the need of intense help and care."
Reversible peaceful mode button,https://www.hackster.io/rachael2/reversible-peaceful-mode-button-f8b8f9,"One of the most popular games in human history is Minecraft. Each year, gamers spend hundreds of hours on that game, building their dream house and enjoying the freedom of exploration in the game. However, there is a very annoying mob in the game called “creeper”. Once a creeper locates the player, it will explode and harm the player. The only way for the player to avoid damage is by quickly running away. Yet, when the player’s mobility is restricted, it becomes very challenging to avoid such a situation. Is it fair to punish our disabled gamers with such asituation, not because they are not good at the game but because they simply cannot respond so fast? The answer is NO. Therefore, in this design, we propose a solution to such a situation, by giving our disabled gamer a button to change to “peaceful mode” instantaneously. Simultaneously the life-threatening creeper will disappear with that simple hit. The button is connected to the keyboard, and it is big enough so hitting it during an emergency is very simple. This button even provides a reversible feature, meaning that hitting the button again turns off the “peaceful mode” and our gamer can enjoy the game again. This is THE key to make Minecraft accessible and inclusive to ALL."
